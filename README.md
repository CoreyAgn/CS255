Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well?
The client was the company DriverPass. The client wanted me to design a system that would allow their customer to use their services, practice tests, and driving practice. The system also needed to be accessible anywhere, allow for many reports to be downloaded, and allow for changes in the packages they offer to customers. In my report, I effectively identified limitations and scope creep. We used a template interview, which provided a general consensus on the client's requirements, but it lacked specifics on the finished product's appearance and budgetary concerns.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could revise one piece of work on these documents, it would be my UML Case Diagram. I would improve it by adding more use cases and making it look less like a jumbled mess.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Although we used an interview that was in text form, it provided us with some of the requirements the business needed, such as scheduling appointments for the in-person driving tests. It is essential to consider the user's needs when designing, as we are building the product for them. If we do not provide the functionality they require, the company may need to go back and add it. If we have to go back and change/add features, it is both a loss of time and money for the company that has to fix it.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
When starting to design software, understanding the requirements and existing systems is critical to make the product the customer wants. When analyzing and designing a system, taking detailed notes and hosting several rounds of interviews is a must. If you do not understand the business you are making the software for, you are bound to make a system with issues or one that the customer does not like. The customers' satisfaction is paramount in both staying in business and making the product in a timely manner.
